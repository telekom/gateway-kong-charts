# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with `.specify/memory/constitution.md` principles:

- [ ] **Values-First Configuration**: All new configuration exposed in `values.yaml` with defaults and documentation
- [ ] **Template Simplicity**: Templates are readable, use named templates for complex logic, single responsibility per file
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Changes follow semver, breaking changes documented with migration path
- [ ] **Platform Portability**: No platform-specific assumptions in core templates, extensions use `platforms/*.yaml`
- [ ] **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features disabled by default, required values validated with helpful errors
- [ ] **Observability**: Health probes configured, structured logging enabled, resource limits set
- [ ] **Security by Default**: Secure defaults, secrets properly managed, least-privilege security contexts
- [ ] **Helm Best Practices**: Standard labels, `_helpers.tpl` usage, validation with `required` function
- [ ] **Testing**: Changes validated with `helm lint`, `helm template`, and test deployment
- [ ] **Documentation**: README, values comments, and CHANGELOG updated in same PR

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
