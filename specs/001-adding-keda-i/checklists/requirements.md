# Specification Quality Checklist: KEDA-Based Autoscaling for Gateway

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All three user stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- 17 functional requirements cover metric-based, schedule-based, and anti-flapping capabilities
  - Added FR-009a for independent CPU and memory threshold configuration
- 9 success criteria provide measurable outcomes for cost savings, performance, and stability
  - Added SC-009 for memory-based scaling validation
- User Story 1 now includes 6 acceptance scenarios covering CPU, memory, and combined metric scaling
- Edge cases expanded to include CPU/memory threshold interaction scenarios
- Assumptions clearly document external dependencies (KEDA installation, metrics sources)
- Backward compatibility explicitly addressed in requirements
