# KEDA ClusterTriggerAuthentication Example for Victoria Metrics
# 
# NOTE: This template is NOT needed when using an existing ClusterTriggerAuthentication.
# The ClusterTriggerAuthentication resource (e.g., "eni-keda-vmselect-creds") must be 
# created separately by cluster administrators and is shared across all namespaces.
#
# This file is kept as a reference example showing what the ClusterTriggerAuthentication
# resource should look like if you need to create it manually.
#
# Example ClusterTriggerAuthentication (created by cluster admin):
#
# apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
# kind: ClusterTriggerAuthentication
# metadata:
#   name: eni-keda-vmselect-creds
# spec:
#   secretTargetRef:
#   - parameter: username
#     name: victoria-metrics-secret
#     key: username
#     namespace: monitoring
#   - parameter: password
#     name: victoria-metrics-secret
#     key: password
#     namespace: monitoring
#
# The chart will reference this ClusterTriggerAuthentication by name in the ScaledObject:
#
# authenticationRef:
#   name: eni-keda-vmselect-creds
#   kind: ClusterTriggerAuthentication
